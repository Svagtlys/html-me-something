                    <h2>Creativity</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm not an artist every day, but sometimes I have a craving to create. Usually, my art is text based: stories, D&D encounters, even entire worlds, built from scratch, word by word, pulled from the deepest pits of my mind.
                        Occasionally, though, my mindset is just right for visual arts, especially with mediums that allow me the same redoability as pencil and paper; polymer clay and computer modeling are my go-tos.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Theatre of Words</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/brandara-svagtlys">Brandara</a> is derived from my very first (albeit underdeveloped) world, but she is my favorite. A fantasy world with an epic history, Brandara is everything I love about Robert Jordan's "The Wheel of Time" and Brandon Sanderson's "The Stormlight Archive", twisted into a new pattern with my own ideas about magic and nature, as well as my desires for the stories I want to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another universe that exists only in my mind, the <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-simulation-hypothesis-svagtlys">Simulation Hypothesis</a> is set in the distant future, with historical articles leaking into the near future. It is founded from my love of futuristic technology, but is different from Brandara in that there <em>is</em> a main character, the as-yet unnamed journalist, whose position is deeply inspired by Doctor Who- a peaceful watcher and recorder of events, who sometimes steps in to push things the "right" direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dungeons & Dragons, as well as other tabletop roleplaying games, builds upon my love of written words by expanding them into playable scenarios which I can share with my friends and acquaintances. Not only are these sessions a way to destress and socialize, but my players test my ideas and provide good feedback that I can then integrate into my projects. Don't worry: in appreciation of their constructive criticism and the hard work they put into defeating monsters, I reward them richly with rare magical items, and very few <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">falling rocks</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>A More Visible Medium</h3>
                    <p>
                        Though I find writing to be the most flexible of mediums, polymer clay is a close second. There's no erasure marks when I mess up, it won't dry out (despite being forgotten on the kitchen table!), and if I decide that I don't like what I'm making, there's no waste: I simply flatten my piece and reuse the clay.
                    </p>
                    <p style="overflow:auto;">
                        <img src = "images/AllBetter.png" width="45%" height="45%" style="float:right;"
                        alt="3D rendering of pink sprinkle donut and white ceramic mug with blue stripes."/>
                        The second visual art medium that I have wet my fingers with is 3D modeling, though I can't say it's nearly as peaceful as the clay; the render shown here is my only completed project. I have found that the process of creating anything complex (as I often attempt), is just as hard as doing the same with my clay, except that the program crashes or my laptop can't handle the render and then all I'm left with is a gray, so-close-to-done project. I will pick this hobby up again when I have a more powerful computer, but for now I am satisfied looking at my "Mug and Donut".
                    </p>  
                    <p>
                        There are times when I just want to <em>make</em> something, and that's achieved quickest with directions and strict rules on how to complete each step. For this, I search for what I'd like to make, then use the creative skills I learned earliest in life- crochet and origami- and follow the instructions. The end result isn't original to me, but it's just as good as a clay creature for pointing at and saying, "I made this."

                    <h2>Computers</h2>
                    <p>
                        Computers are difficult things to understand, and even more difficult to control in exactly the way you planned: my own process of getting to where I am now was multi-step, starting when I was a young child watching my mother on take-your-kid-to-work day, and going through even to the present day.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
                    <p>
                        My mother lead me on my first forray into the world of making a computer do what I require when I was in elementary school. She showed me keyboard shortcuts, clicking and dragging, all the little tricks to use a computer quicker. Then, as I grew older and she advanced in her career, we learned spreadsheet formulas together- basic math, formatting cells, creating charts, even loading a certain list depending on an input. Over time, I made a lot of simple sheets for my worlds to help with measurements, a budget sheet which helps me plan for small and large purchases, and a very large and resource-intensive character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons, which would help ease character creation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Programs</h3>
                    <p>
                        All of this knowledge of spreadsheets, and yet I was stil so limited in what I could do, so I turned to programming classes in my high school years. Computer science, the course was called, and we did learn more than just how to write a runnable program- the history of computers and programming languages, and the current major usage of many of those langauges, as well as good techniques for planning coding projects and the reasons you want to do that planning. I realize now how lucky I was to have such a passionate teacher who encouraged me in my own love for coding with interesting projects, intriguing problems, and in my senior year he even convinced me to join the UIL team, where I advanced to regionals and placed sixth out of a college lecture hall full of testers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Internet Integration, Hosting, and Websites</h3>
                    <p>
                        I quickly learned, after I graduated and joined the adult world, that being able to write a basic game or program is all well and good, but then it's stuck on your computer, with no one else able to enjoy it. The fact that I didn't know how to make something to share with everyone, and my desire at the time for a bot more tailored to my needs when running a D&D game over Discord, led me to write my first major solo project, Drystan, in the early spring of 2019. Over the course of this project, I learned what an API is, used a wrapper for Python so my bot could interact with the chat app, utilized the Google Cloud Platform to create credentials for Drystan so that it could interact with sheets through the Sheets API, and I even looked into web-hosting for my bot, though I eventually decided to wait until I could set up my Pi as a 24/7 host.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This brings me to the present, where I'm taking a course covering Javascript and Java Spring Boot, as well as other elements, such as CSS, HTML, and Git, which I agree are essential to being a valuable, "Renaissance" coder. I greatly enjoy the process of learning, and the new techniques shown to me for planning and collaborating. I hope to take what I've learned here, as well as throughout my life in the computer realm, and join one of the community projects I love to watch and have always wanted to help build.

                    Sometimes what a person shows you, or what you can learn about them from one source of information, isn't all there is to know, and sometimes that lack of knowledge can result in what amounts to judging a book by its cover, despite thinking you've read it front to back. People are incredible, inconceivable, multi-faceted creatures, and while what you've read on this page is not a full biography of me, I hope that you can say you know me more now than you would have after a chat in a crowded restuarant, or watching an IDE be filled with all the code necessary for a "Hello, World" program.
