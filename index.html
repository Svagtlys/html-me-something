                        <h2>Creativity</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm not an artist every day, but sometimes I have a craving to create. Usually, my art is text based: stories, D&D encounters, even entire worlds, built from scratch, word by word, pulled from the deepest pits of my mind.
                            Occasionally, though, my mindset is just right for visual arts, especially with mediums that allow me the same redoability as pencil and paper; polymer clay and computer modeling are my go-tos.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Theatre of Words</h3>
                        <p>
                            <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/brandara-svagtlys">Brandara</a> is derived from my very first (albeit underdeveloped) world, but she is my favorite. A fantasy world with an epic history, Brandara is everything I love about Robert Jordan's "The Wheel of Time" and Brandon Sanderson's "The Stormlight Archive", twisted into a new pattern with my own ideas about magic and nature, as well as my desires for the stories I want to write.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another universe that exists only in my mind, the <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-simulation-hypothesis-svagtlys">Simulation Hypothesis</a> is set in the distant future, with historical articles leaking into the near future. It is founded from my love of futuristic technology, but is different from Brandara in that there <em>is</em> a main character, the as-yet unnamed journalist, whose position is deeply inspired by Doctor Who- a peaceful watcher and recorder of events, who sometimes steps in to push things the "right" direction.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dungeons & Dragons, as well as other tabletop roleplaying games, builds upon my love of written words by expanding them into playable scenarios which I can share with my friends and acquaintances. Not only are these sessions a way to destress and socialize, but my players test my ideas and provide good feedback that I can then integrate into my projects. Don't worry: in appreciation of their constructive criticism and the hard work they put into defeating monsters, I reward them richly with rare magical items, and very few <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RocksFallEveryoneDies">falling rocks</a>.

                        <h3>A More Visible Medium</h3>
                        <p>
                            Though I find writing to be the most flexible of mediums, polymer clay is a close second. There's no erasure marks when I mess up, it won't dry out (despite being forgotten on the kitchen table!), and if I decide that I don't like what I'm making, there's no waste: I simply flatten my piece and reuse the clay.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <img src = "images/AllBetter.png" width="45%" height="45%" style="position:relative;top:15px;float:right;"
                            alt="3D rendering of pink sprinkle donut and white ceramic mug with blue stripes."/>
                            The second visual art medium that I have wet my fingers with is 3D modeling, though I can't say it's nearly as peaceful as the clay; the render shown here is my only completed project. I have found that the process of creating anything complex (as I often attempt), is just as hard as doing the same with my clay, except that the program crashes or my laptop can't handle the render and then all I'm left with is a gray, so-close-to-done project. I will pick this hobby up again when I have a more powerful computer, but for now I am satisfied looking at my "Mug and Donut".
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                            There are times when I just want to <em>make</em> something, and that's achieved quickest with directions and strict rules on how to complete each step. For this, I search for what I'd like to make, then use the creative skills I learned earliest in life- crochet and origami- and follow the instructions. The end result isn't original to me, but it's just as good as a clay creature for pointing at and saying, "I made this."

                        <h3>Spreadsheets</h3>
                        <p>
                            My mother lead me on my first forray into the world of making a computer do what I require when I was in elementary school. She showed me keyboard shortcuts, clicking and dragging, all the little tricks to use a computer quicker. Then, as I grew older and she advanced in her career, we learned spreadsheet formulas together- basic math, formatting cells, creating charts, even loading a certain list depending on an input. Over time, I made a lot of simple sheets for my worlds to help with measurements, a budget sheet which helps me plan for small and large purchases, and a very large and resource-intensive character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons, which would help ease character creation.

                        <h3>Programs</h3>
                        <p>
                            All of this knowledge of spreadsheets, and yet I was stil so limited in what I could do, so I turned to programming classes in my high school years.

                <p>
                    Complete by 12/2. This is a very moving call to action for myself, and a wish that the reader helps make the world a better place in their own way (heavily implying that hiring me is a great step in the right direction)
