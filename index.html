                        I'm not an artist every day, but sometimes I have a craving to create. Usually, my art is text based: stories, D&D encounters, even entire worlds, built from scratch, word by word, pulled from the deepest pits of my mind.
                        Occasionally, though, my mindset is just right for visual arts, especially with mediums that allow me the same redoability as pencil and paper; polymer clay and computer modeling are my go-tos.
                        This is where I tell people about my creative side (stories, worlds, D&D, 3D modeling, clay, designing), and how sometimes I lose my creative spark for a while, and how it can bring me down

                    <h3>Brandara, The Simulation Hypothesis, and Dungeons & Dragons</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/brandara-svagtlys">Brandara</a> is derived from my very first (albeit underdeveloped) world, but she is my favorite. A fantasy world with an epic history, Brandara is everything I love about Robert Jordan's "The Wheel of Time" and Brandon Sanderson's "The Stormlight Archive", twisted into a new pattern with my own ideas about magic and nature, as well as my desires for the stories I want to write.

                        Another universe that exists only in my mind, the <a href="https://www.worldanvil.com/w/the-simulation-hypothesis-svagtlys">Simulation Hypothesis</a> is set in the distant future, with historical articles leaking into the near future. It is founded from my love of futuristic technology, but is different from Brandara in that there <em>is</em> a main character, the as-yet unnamed journalist, whose position is deeply inspired by Doctor Who- a peaceful watcher and recorder of events.

                    <p>
                        Dungeons & Dragons, as well as other similar tabletop roleplaying games, builds upon my love of written words by expanding those into playable scenarios which I can share with my friends and acquaintances. Sometimes having others interact with your ideas helps you flesh them out.

                    <p>
                        This is where I speak about my problem solving side, because people can be computers, too (math, research, customer service, coding), and how sometimes I overthink things and choose wrong, or burn myself out

            <p>
                This is a very moving call to action for myself, and a wish that the reader helps make the world a better place in their own way (heavily implying that hiring me is a great step in the right direction)
